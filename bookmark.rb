# Bookmark to do the following:

# An initializer that accepts url and title parameters:
# 1) It should set instance variables named url, title
# 2) It should set a read only variable name last_visited

# A method name visit! which sets last_visited to the current time and date
# (hint: the Time.now method returns an instance of Time)
